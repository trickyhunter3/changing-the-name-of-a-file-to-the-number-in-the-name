# changing-the-name-of-a-file-to-the-number-in-the-name
you need to just enter folder path (you don't need \ at the end).

this program changing the file name(i think a lot of file types) into the number in it , like if you have a file_name 
This-TvShow-Episode-[01]-[Resolution-1080p] - it will change into this - 1 - ,

it's just rename but automatic and fast with a lot of files - it changed 120 MKV files in a 5 sec~. ,

bug will happen if 1.there is something with the directory(not existing or too long...etc) 2. same episodes: in the folder if there is the same episodes it will try to rename the
first (it will work) but when it will reach the second it will crash because it can not rename to an existing name.

if you want to change all the files into "something" + number_in_the_name + file_type then just make a option like "press 1 or 2"then you do some goto or more if.

please let me know if there is something to fix or some more bugs Thanks
