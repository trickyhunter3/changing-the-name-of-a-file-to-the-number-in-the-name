# changing-the-name-of-a-file-to-the-number-in-the-name
this program changing the file name(i think a lot of file types) into the number in it , like if you have a file_name 
This-TvShow-Episode-[01]-[Resolution-1080p] - it will change into this - 1 -
it's just rename but automatic and fast with a lot of files - it changed 120 MKV files in 5 sec
there is a a bug if you have episode 0 it will change the episode to -1 (if there is no resoultion on it) ,  and if there is a resolution it will change into that number
