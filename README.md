# changing-the-name-of-a-file-to-the-number-in-the-name - or (Change Name V2)

this program changing the file name into the number in it , like if you have a file_name 
This-TvShow-Episode-[01]-[Resolution-1080p] - it will change into this' SeriesName - S01E01 ',

series name is the name of the second parent like this - [ D:\TvShows\ShowName\Season 01\episode01.mkv]

it's fast,

please let me know if there is something to fix or some more bugs Thanks (Email: workingdenniss@gmail.com)
